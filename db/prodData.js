    "Black Cloud Bow",
    "Once every century the winds of the Great Ice Fields of Ispar undergo a sudden change in pattern. Violent storms will erupt upon the land, vastly changing the frozen landscape. It is only then that the fabled Black Isle of the Frozen Waste appears and it is the only on this isle that Black Ice may be harvested. Hard as stone and supple as wood, Black Ice is the choice building material for all sorts of magical weapons. It is quite rare to see Black Ice. Rarer still to see so much Black Ice used in one item.",

    "Deru Limb",
    "All the Deru can trace their ancestry to the First Tree, because they all were once twigs on its great trunk. It is said that the First Tree has seen the beginning of the world and that when the First Tree perishes, so will the world. On rare occasions the First Tree will grant a blessing to those that show exceptional awareness of the cycles of life. This wand is one such gift. This wand must be cultivated from the First Tree in such a way that no knife is used. The petitioner must pray and coax a piece of the First Tree so that the limb will naturally fall off the tree, neither harming the First Tree nor the new limb.",

    "Thunderhead",
    "The head of this mace seems to be made of pure copper. Large silvered spikes protrude from the head of the mace. Inscriptions of power are etched into the spikes, causing arcs of electrical energy to coruscate menacingly across the length of the weapon. Some say that when an enemy is struck by this mace, he hears a loud crash, similar to the sound of thunder. Of course, it could just be that the thunderclap the enemy hears is only the sound of a large, blunt, electrified object crashing into his own head.",

    "This weapon was forged by smiths underneath the mighty Lugian fortress of Linvak Tukal to serve as a goodwill gift in celebration of the alliance between humans and Lugians. Lord Kresovus and Queen Elysa had intended to organize a festival and games to commemorate the alliance, with this mace to be given to the human winner of a tournament of strength. Unfortunately, the Lugian courier carrying this beautiful weapon to Queen Elysa was ambushed and killed. The festival was quietly cancelled.",
